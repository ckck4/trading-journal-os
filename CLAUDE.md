# TRADINGJOURNAL — Project Operating Rules

## Always follow the UI system
- Source of truth: /ux/ui_design_bible.md
- Also read: /ux/03_components_design_system.md, /ux/02_core_flows.md, /ux/01_screens_inventory.md

## Worktree boundaries (no cross-editing)
- UI worktree:     ../TRADINGJOURNAL-ui
- Auth worktree:   ../TRADINGJOURNAL-auth
- API worktree:    ../TRADINGJOURNAL-api
- Import worktree: ../TRADINGJOURNAL-import

## Output expectations
- No generic guidance. Make concrete code changes.
- Small commits, clear messages.
- Write progress to /docs/status/<area>.md in your own worktree.
- If unsure, use WebFetch to confirm (official docs preferred).
