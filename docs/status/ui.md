# UI Status Update

- **Phase 7 Grading**: Added custom React Hooks pointing to standard API endpoints for creating, reading, and updating `trade_grades` and `trade_confluences`. These match the new strict grading criteria instead of the custom-length rubric generator. Embedded these deeply inside the Trade detail slide-over. Connected Confluences directly to Strategy assigned context. Placed interactive Grade Badges successfully in the `/journal` listing table. Fixed typing inconsistencies globally caused by dropping deprecated Rubric API models.
- **Phase 6 Goals & Habits UI**: Implemented main `/goals` page with tabs for Goals and Habits, 4 top KPI stat cards, and Bento grid cards. Connected `Create`/`Edit`/`Delete`/`Mark Complete`/`Update Progress` actions to API endpoints with cache invalidation via React Query mutations. Installed required shadcn components (Tabs, Select, AlertDialog, Dialog, Progress).
- **Phase 6 Strategies UI**: Implemented main `/strategies` page with responsive KPI bento-grid, filter toggles, Strategy cards with statistical snapshots, New/Edit Strategy Dialogs, and a sliding read-only Rules Sheet. Uses React Query mutations with invalidate cache to keep UI perfectly in sync with the DB.
- **Finance Manager Pages**: Completed `finance`, `ledger`, `finance/settings` UI layouts with active navigation. Includes complex dynamic client-side charts mapping aggregated `cashflow` data and `expenses`/`payouts` data across rolling configurable windows.
- **Notebook Sliding Panel Fix**: Restored Notebook to correctly overlay dynamically without unmounting or triggering horizontal scroll overflow, fixing the CSS isolation between `TradeDetailPanel` and `NotebookPanel`.
